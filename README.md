## Machine Learning Internship - Task 1
### Project Title
Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

### Description
This project is completed as a part of the Machine Learning Internship at "RD Infro Technology". The aim of this project is to define the business problem and Machine Learning objective for predicting whether a customer will churn or not. Customer churn prediction helps businesses retain customers by identifying customers who are likely to leave in future stages of analysis.

### Business Problem
Will the customer churn?

### Machine Learning Objective
To predict whether a customer will churn or not.

### ML Task Type
Binary Classification

### Target Variable
Churn

### Tasks Performed
Defined the business problem for customer churn prediction Identified the Machine Learning objective Determined the ML task type as Binary Classification Specified the target variable (Churn) Implemented the problem statement using Python variables Displayed the defined problem details using print() statements

### Tools Used
Python Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

### Outcome
The business problem for customer churn prediction was clearly defined, and the Machine Learning objective, task type, and target variable were identified. This provides a clear foundation for implementing a Binary Classification model for customer churn prediction in future stages of the project.
